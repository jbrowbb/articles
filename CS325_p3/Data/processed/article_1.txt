The YouTube star eventually launched several spin-off channels, including Film Theorists, Food Theorists and Style Theorists. As of January, the gaming channel alone has amassed 18.4 million subscribers.Last year, MatPat hosted theStreamy Awards, which scored 15 million views across all digital platforms in its first 48 hours. The 2023 awards ceremony set a record as the most-watched show in the event’s 13-year history, beating the 2021 record of 9.7 million views.Popular on VarietyMatPat explained in his farewell video that he wanted to spend more time with his family, having been “work first for over a decade.”“We knew that honestly, we didn’t want to do this forever,” MatPat said. “As much as I love you and I love overthinking things, and I love theorizing, I don’t love late nights.”“I miss the days where I could just sit down on the couch with [Stephanie] and play video games, and it’s not for content,” he continued. “Or I’m playing a game, and I’m not thinking about what theories are gonna come out of that. I miss it.”Read More About:YouTubeCommentsJavaScript is required to load the comments.Loading comments...Most PopularRyan Gosling and Kate McKinnon’s ‘Close Encounter’ Sketch Sends ‘SNL’ Cold Open Into HystericsRyan Gosling Said ‘100% No’ When First Asked to Sing ‘I’m Just Ken’ Live at the Oscars Because ‘There’s a Lot of Ways That Could Go Wrong…Grimes Faces ‘Major Technical Difficulties’ During Coachella 2024 Set: ‘Don’t Judge Me for Being Bad at Calculating Things…Michael J.
